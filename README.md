# Fitness-Predictor
Simple study of Regression and Classification Analysis.

* A Simple Dataset is picked from Kaggle that could be used for Regression Analysis and Classification too.

* This is a simple project used to understand the differences between Testing, Accuracy calculations and Validation.

* Data cleaning differences can also be observed.

* One-Hot Encoding and its need and usefulness can be understood and studied.

* Data Preparation for both techniques and the difference between them can be studied too 

* Models Used:
    * Regression:
        * Decision Tree Regressor
        * Gausian Naive Bayes Regressor
        * Linear Regressor
        * Support Vector Reggresor.
    * Classification:
        * Decision Tree Classifier.
        * Logistic Regression
        * Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier.


* Different types of Bagging, Boosting (ADA Boost) and Stacking Classifiers are also shown.
